# ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT MCP LLAMA STACK

Welcome to the Eligibility Assessment System powered by Llama Stack and Model Context Protocol (MCP)!
This system helps assess eligibility for Family Care Unpaid Leave Support based on the Republic of Lysmark's Act No. 2025/47-SA.
To get started quickly, jump straight to [installation](#install).

## Detailed description 

The Eligibility Assessment MCP Llama Stack system is an intelligent solution for evaluating eligibility for Family Care Unpaid Leave Support based on the Republic of Lysmark's legislation (Act No. 2025/47-SA and related regulations). The system combines the power of Llama Stack with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware assessments.

This system is designed to help users understand their eligibility for unpaid leave assistance in various family care situations, including care for sick/injured family members, childcare for multiple children, adoption cases, and single-parent family scenarios.

This deployment includes a Helm chart for setting up:

- An OpenShift AI Project with all necessary components
- Llama Stack distribution with Llama 3.1 8B model for natural language processing  
- MCP server for the eligibility engine with specialized knowledge processing
- Vector database (Milvus) with embedded legal documents for RAG capabilities
- Document loader service to populate the knowledge base with Act No. 2025/47-SA and regulations
- Llama Stack Playground interface for interactive eligibility consultations

Use this project to quickly deploy an intelligent eligibility assessment system that provides accurate, legally-informed guidance on Family Care Unpaid Leave Support eligibility. 🏛️

### See it in action

Experience the Eligibility Assessment System through the Llama Stack Playground interface. After deployment, you can interact with the system to:
- Ask questions about eligibility requirements for different family care scenarios
- Get detailed assessments based on the legal framework of Act No. 2025/47-SA
- Understand the documentation needed for applications
- Learn about financial assistance amounts and duration limits

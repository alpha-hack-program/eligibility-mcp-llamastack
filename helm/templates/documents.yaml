    ## GUIDANCE NOTE No. 2025/61-FR/INT  
    ### Application of the Progressive Income Tax and Surcharge Act (Act No. 2025/61-FR)  

    **Effective:** 1 January 2026  
    **Audience:** Tax Officers, Regional Tax Offices  
    **Classification:** Internal – Operational Guidance  

    ---

    ## 1. Purpose  

    This Guidance Note explains the method of assessment, calculation, and enforcement of the progressive income tax introduced under Act No. 2025/61-FR. It is intended for use by tax officers in reviewing declarations, issuing assessments, and advising taxpayers.  

    ---

    ## 2. General Principles  

    1. **Progressive Taxation**: Tax liability increases as income rises, with different brackets applying different marginal rates.  
    2. **Bracket Application**: Only income above a threshold is taxed at the higher rate.  
    3. **Surcharge**: Applied if the total tax (before surcharge) exceeds **5000**.  

    ---

    ## 3. Step-by-Step Assessment Method  

    ### Step 1 – Determine Taxable Income  
    - Start with declared gross income.  
    - Deduct allowable expenses (as defined under the General Tax Code).  
    - Confirm residency for the fiscal year.  

    ### Step 2 – Apply Brackets  
    - **First Bracket**: Income up to 10000 → taxed at 10%.  
    - **Second Bracket**: Any income above 10000 → taxed at 20%.  

    ### Step 3 – Calculate Base Tax  
    - Add the amounts from each bracket to determine base tax liability.  

    ### Step 4 – Test for Surcharge  
    - If base tax > 5000, apply surcharge = 2% × base tax.  

    ### Step 5 – Issue Assessment  
    - Record both base tax and surcharge clearly in notice.  
    - Ensure taxpayer is informed of payment deadline.  

    ---

    ## 4. Worked Examples  

    ### Example A – Middle Income  
    Taxpayer earns **40000**.  
    - First 10000 × 10% = 1000  
    - Remaining 30000 × 20% = 6000  
    - Base Tax = 7000  
    - Since > 5000, surcharge = 2% × 7000 = 140  
    - **Total Tax = 7,140**  

    ### Example B – Low Income  
    Taxpayer earns **8000**.  
    - Entire 8000 falls within first bracket: 8000 × 10% = 800  
    - Base Tax = 800 (< 5000) → No surcharge  
    - **Total Tax = 800**  

    ### Example C – High Income  
    Taxpayer earns **120000**.  
    - First 10000 × 10% = 1000  
    - Remaining 110000 × 20% = 22000  
    - Base Tax = 23000  
    - Surcharge = 2% × 23000 = 460  
    - **Total Tax = 23,460**  

    ---

    ## 5. Compliance and Enforcement  

    - **Timeliness**: Ensure notices are issued within 90 days of filing.  
    - **Interest**: Apply statutory 4% annual interest on overdue balances.  
    - **Penalties**: Non-filers must be reported to Enforcement Division.  
    - **Documentation**: Officers must retain assessment calculations in taxpayer’s digital file.  

    ---

    ## 6. Appeals  

    - Appeals must be filed within 30 days.  
    - Officers must provide complete reasoning and evidence for contested assessments.  
    - All appeal submissions must be logged in the Fiscal Case Management System (FCMS).  

    ---

    ## 7. Closing Notes  

    This Guidance Note shall be reviewed annually by the Directorate of Tax Administration. Updates will be issued in response to amendments in legislation or CPI-index adjustments of income brackets.

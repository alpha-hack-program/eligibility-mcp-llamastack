    ### PREAMBLE

    The Parliament of the Republic of Lysmark, recognizing the importance of predictable priority rules in structured financing arrangements, and seeking to promote efficient capital markets while protecting creditor rights, hereby establishes mandatory waterfall distribution rules for multi-tier debt structures.

    ---

    ## Article 1 — Purpose and Scope

    1. This Act governs the distribution of available cash or assets among multiple classes of creditors in structured financing arrangements.
    2. It applies to:
       - Syndicated loans with multiple tranches
       - Secured debt with senior/junior structures
       - Corporate insolvency distributions
       - Project finance repayment waterfalls
    3. This Act does not affect equal-ranking creditors, who share pro rata.

    ---

    ## Article 2 — Hierarchy of Claims

    1. Claims shall be satisfied in the following strict order of priority:
       - **Tier 1: Senior Debt** — highest priority
       - **Tier 2: Junior (Subordinated) Debt** — intermediate priority
       - **Tier 3: Equity** — residual claimants
    2. No distribution to a lower tier may occur until the immediately higher tier is fully satisfied.
    3. This hierarchy is mandatory and may not be contractually reversed.

    ---

    ## Article 3 — Senior Debt Priority

    1. **Senior creditors** must receive 100% of their outstanding claims before any distribution to junior creditors or equity holders.
    2. If available cash is insufficient to satisfy senior debt in full:
       - All available cash goes entirely to senior creditors
       - Junior creditors receive zero
       - Equity holders receive zero
    3. Senior debt includes principal, accrued interest, and any contractually agreed fees.

    ---

    ## Article 4 — Junior Debt Allocation

    1. **Junior creditors** may only receive payment from cash remaining after full satisfaction of senior claims.
    2. If remaining cash exceeds junior debt obligations:
       - Junior creditors are paid in full
       - Excess proceeds to equity
    3. If remaining cash is less than junior debt obligations:
       - Junior creditors receive the entire remaining balance
       - Equity receives zero

    ---

    ## Article 5 — Residual Equity Distribution

    1. **Equity holders** may only receive distributions from cash remaining after full payment of both senior and junior debt.
    2. Equity distributions are discretionary and subject to organizational governance rules.
    3. Residual amounts belong to equity holders proportionate to their ownership stakes.

    ---

    ## Article 6 — Calculation Methodology

    Distribution shall be calculated using this sequential process:

    1. **Step 1:** Identify total cash available for distribution
    2. **Step 2:** Allocate to senior debt = MIN(cash available, senior debt outstanding)
    3. **Step 3:** Calculate remaining cash = cash available - senior allocation
    4. **Step 4:** Allocate to junior debt = MIN(remaining cash, junior debt outstanding)
    5. **Step 5:** Calculate final remainder = remaining cash - junior allocation
    6. **Step 6:** Allocate remainder to equity

    ---

    ## Article 7 — Enforcement and Penalties

    1. Distributions made in violation of priority rules constitute breach of fiduciary duty.
    2. Creditors improperly subordinated may void the distribution and seek full restitution.
    3. Officers or directors authorizing non-compliant distributions face personal liability.

    ---

    ## Article 8 — Reporting Requirements

       - Outstanding amounts by creditor tier
       - Cash available for distribution
       - Actual allocations made

    2. The Ministry of Finance and Credit Markets may audit compliance.
